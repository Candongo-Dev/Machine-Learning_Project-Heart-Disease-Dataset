# Machine-Learning_Project-Heart-Disease-Dataset
Predicting Heart Disease with Python and Machine Learning. In this project, in the first part we will explore and prepare the data before starting the Machine Learning models. Let's try to predict which people have heart problems based on personal and health data. we use some Machine Learning models to make the predictions.
